The PDA Visualizer project utilizes Python code to generate dot code for Pushdown Automaton (PDA) state transition diagrams. The code has input stack symbols, transitions, and the initial stack state. The resulting dot code can be seamlessly pasted into an online PDA visualizer, producing clear and concise diagrams for efficient PDA analysis.
